## My TODO Project (with React)
    In this project, I made a TODO List using React, one of the Javascript libraries.
       
    command: yarn start
    
    < Runs the app in the development mode >
      - terminal command : yarn start
    
    < Deploy link >
      - https://mytodolist0784.netlify.app/
      
    < My TODO Feautres >
      1. All, Active, and Completed filters.
      2. Data is saved, even if the page is refreshed.
      3. DarkMode
      4. Four basic operations such as CRUD is working.
